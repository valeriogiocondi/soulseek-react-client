# soulseek-react-client
WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a Soulseek React Client. It's just UI (React/Redux/React-router) based on NPM package slsk-client https://www.npmjs.com/package/slsk-client.

This project also needs a nodejs middleware between React UI and slsk-client, and I have in another repository.


Soulseek is a music P2P network. More infos at http://www.slsknet.org/news/
